              <p class="leading-6 text-gray-700">The following are notes shared with us on what you like and don't like about other websites are a great way to see how these font choices work as paragraphs.<p>

              <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-700">Love the <a href="https://www.junehomesupply.com/?v=7516fd43adaa">clean simple look</a> and neutral earthy tones. Don't like how long the home page is when you scroll down. Or the setup of the text on the left of the top image. I don't like the font used for the headings "New" "Kitchen" "Bath" "Utility". It's too spread out.</p>

              <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-700">I like the simplicity of <a href="https://www.sezane.com/us">this site</a>.</p>

              <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-700">I like <a href="https://www.sustainla.com/">this website</a> A LOT. I like the header photo with their tagline. And I like that the menu is really simple and easy to navigate. I like the flower design with the white background that separates the header photo and the next pictures so that it doesn't look too overcrowded or busy with photos. I like all the fonts used.</p>

              <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-700">I find <a href="https://notoxlife.com">this website</a> a bit plain and boring. Nothing really stands out.</p>

              <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-700">I generally like white and black designs with a few hints of neutral or earthy tones.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl">Color Palette - Option Two</h2>

          <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-700">First we'll need to pick 1 to 2 colors to serve as the primary colors for your brand. Your primary color(s) will become the color people think of when they think of your brand (e.g. "Facebook Blue"). After we have a direction for your main color (or two), we'll add some supporting colors that work cohesively with that. We'll need some supporting colors for all of the little user interface components needed for every website (buttons, etc.).</p>

          <p class="pt-2 leading-6 text-gray-900">
            Note: If you like any shade within these swatches we can build your design around that shade.
